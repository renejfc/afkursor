# AFKursor

Simple script that moves the cursor around the screen with a pong-like motion while you're afk.

> [!NOTE]  
> This package is bun-only, so you'll need [bun](https://bun.sh/).

## Usage
I'd recommend just executing it on the fly with:
```sh
bunx afkursor
```

If for any reason you want it in your machine *(more frequent and faster use)*, you can install it globally:
```sh
bun add -g afkursor
```

And then execute it like:
```sh
afkursor
```

> [!WARNING]
> Currently it doesn't work with WSL *(it works fine on Windows though)*
