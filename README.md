## Usage
> [!NOTE]  
> This package is bun-only, so you'll need [bun](https://bun.sh/).

I'd recommend just executing it on the fly:
```sh
bunx afkursor
```

If for any reason you want it in your machine, you can install it globally:
```sh
bun add -g afkursor
```

And then execute it like:
```sh
afkursor
```
